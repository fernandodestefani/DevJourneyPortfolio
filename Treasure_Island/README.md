This project was developed as part of Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code" bootcamp. Inspired by the choose-your-own-adventure books created by Ian Livingstone, this Python-based project allows users to embark on an interactive journey where they make decisions to shape the course of a captivating story.

Features:
Utilizes if/elif/else statements in Python to implement decision-making scenarios.
Engaging storytelling reminiscent of fantasy adventure books.
Allows users to navigate through the narrative, making choices that impact the outcome.

How to Run:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Run the main Python script to start the adventure and make choices.

Usage:
Follow the prompts in the terminal/console to make decisions at different points in the story.
Witness how your choices influence the unfolding narrative.
