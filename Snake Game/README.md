## How to Play

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Control the snake's direction using the arrow keys: Up, Down, Left, and Right.
3. Guide the snake to consume the blue food, grow longer, and increase your score.
4. Avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own tail to continue the game.
5. The game ends when the snake collides, and your score is displayed on the screen.

## Features

- **Graphical Interface:** Enjoy a visually appealing snake game with a Turtle graphics interface.
- **Oriented Objects:** The game is structured using object-oriented programming principles for maintainability.
- **Scoreboard:** Keep track of your score and high score, which persists across game sessions in a Python text file.

## Score Persistence

Your high score is saved in a text file (`data.txt`). If you beat your high score, it gets updated. Compete against yourself to achieve the highest score!

Experience the thrill of the Snake Game with a graphical interface and compete for the top score! Run the script, control the snake, and enjoy the classic gameplay with a modern twist. Have fun!
