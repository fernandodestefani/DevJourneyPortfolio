# Hangman Game

This project is a Hangman game developed as part of Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code" bootcamp. The game challenges players to guess a word by inputting letters, with a limited number of lives available.

## How to Play

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. A random word will be selected from the word list.
3. The word will be represented by underscores, and your goal is to guess the correct letters.
4. Enter your guesses by typing a letter and pressing Enter.
5. Incorrect guesses will cost you lives, and the game continues until either you successfully guess the word or run out of lives.

Feel free to play the game, guess the word, and enjoy the Hangman challenge!
