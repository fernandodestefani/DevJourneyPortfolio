# U.S. States Game with Pandas

Dive into the U.S. States Game, an interactive challenge to guess the names of all 50 states! This Python program utilizes the Turtle graphics library for visualization and the powerful Pandas library for data manipulation. The game prompts the user to guess state names, marking correct guesses on the U.S. map. It was developed during Angela Yu's Bootcamp.

## How to Play

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Guess the names of U.S. states by typing them in the prompt.
3. If the guessed state is correct, its name will be displayed on the map.
4. Keep guessing until all 50 states are correctly identified or choose 'Exit' to end the game.
5. The program generates a CSV file ('states_to_learn.csv') listing the states you need to learn.

## Features

- **Turtle Graphics:** Visualize the U.S. map using Turtle graphics with the state names displayed on the correct locations.
- **Pandas Integration:** Utilize the Pandas library for reading state data from '50_states.csv,' managing state names, and creating the 'states_to_learn.csv' file.
- **Interactive Interface:** Input state names through a user-friendly prompt.
- **Progress Tracking:** Monitor the number of correct guesses out of 50.

Challenge yourself with the U.S. States Game, combining Turtle graphics for visualization and Pandas for efficient data handling. Guess the states, enjoy the learning process, and explore the capabilities of Pandas in managing and analyzing data.
