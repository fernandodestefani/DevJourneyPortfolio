# Blackjack Game

This Blackjack game was developed during Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code" bootcamp. Experience the thrill of playing Blackjack against the computer and aim to beat the dealer with a hand value closer to 21.

## How to Play

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. At the start of the game, you and the computer each receive two random cards from a standard deck.
3. You can choose to either get another card ('hit') or pass ('stand') to finalize your hand.
4. The goal is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
5. Face cards are worth 10 points, and Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, whichever benefits you more.

Feel the excitement of Blackjack and challenge yourself against the computer. Enjoy the game!
