# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This project is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game developed as part of Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code" bootcamp. It allows players to engage in a classic game where they choose between Rock, Paper, and Scissors, competing against the computer.

## How to Play

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter your choice by typing:
   - `0` for Rock
   - `1` for Paper
   - `2` for Scissors

## Game Rules

- Rock crushes Scissors.
- Scissors cuts Paper.
- Paper covers Rock.

What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, or 2 for Scissors: 1
The computer will randomly choose one of the options, and the winner will be determined based on the game rules.

Feel free to play the game, make choices, and experience the excitement of this classic Rock-Paper-Scissors showdown!

Happy coding!
