# Caesar Cipher Program

This Caesar Cipher program is inspired by the encryption method used by Julius Caesar and it was developed as part of Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code" bootcamp. It allows users to encode and decode messages by shifting letters in the alphabet.

## How to Use

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Choose the desired operation:
   - Type 'encode' to encrypt a message.
   - Type 'decode' to decrypt a message.
3. Enter the message you want to process.
4. Input the shift number to determine the level of encryption or decryption.
5. The program will display the processed text.
